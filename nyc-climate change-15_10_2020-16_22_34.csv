2020-10-12 09:09:00,5,"Andrew Cuomo, the King of New York",/r/nyc/comments/j9sl6l/andrew_cuomo_the_king_of_new_york/,2020-10-12 10:00:06,5,"> In the fall of 2018, primary challengers beat six of the eight I.D.C. defectors. After Cuomo trounced the Republican candidate, Marc Molinaro, in the gubernatorial race, he started his third term having to contend for the first time with a truly liberal Democratic majority. Last year, the Legislature had its most progressive session ever: new laws were passed addressing rent control, climate change, bail reform, and driver’s licenses for undocumented immigrants. Cuomo, who has in private conversations expressed concern over the leftward lurch of his party, did his best to ride the wave rather than let it wash over him. Now he drove the left nuts in a new way—with, as a Democratic legislator put it recently, “his proclamation of positions that he’s working hard to sabotage.”
>
> “He’s still doing a good job of keeping the crazies at bay,” a prominent Manhattan Democrat told me. He happened to be the kind of Davos Man constituent who Cuomo feared would abandon the city if he were subjected to a new wealth tax, which many progressives have endorsed.
>
> “Cuomo decided years ago, partly by watching his father, that Democrats can’t govern effectively, that they are a tax-and-spend juggernaut, and that any power they have in the Legislature is bad for him,” Bill Lipton, a former political director of the W.F.P., told me. “The ease and consistency with which he does one thing in practice while arguing in public he’s doing the exact opposite—and saying anyone who suggests he’s doing this is crazy—should worry anybody who believes that executives should be transparent and accountable.”
>
> “These are institutional advocates who by their job can never say, ‘It’s enough,’ ” Cuomo told me. “A sitting governor can never satiate advocates. Otherwise, they’re not advocates, by definition. I can’t. My father couldn’t.” Cuomo and his staff, buoyed by their own internal polling and the results of his two primary challenges, contend that he is actually more popular among Democratic voters who consider themselves to be very liberal than he is among those who are closer to the center. They dismiss the W.F.P. as being representative of no one. “They’re not the left,” one of them said. “They don’t represent anybody. They’re a piece of stationery.”
>
> After winning a third term, Cuomo got to work getting back at the Working Families Party. In each of the past two years, he has sneaked a provision into his budget that would almost triple the number of votes a party would need to secure ongoing state financing. The new threshold would be a high hurdle for the W.F.P. On NY1, Jumaane Williams, the New York City public advocate, called Cuomo’s tactics “Trumpian.” Lipton told reporters that the maneuver was “a power grab.” Cuomo, a master of the “Who, me?” defense, dismissed such talk as “conspiracies.”
>
> In his own party, his detractors often speak of him (almost always without attribution, because they are afraid of him) as a brutal boss, a friendless bully, and a paranoid control freak. “It’s not enough for him to win. Other people have to lose,” one said, having lost. Yet there are often caveats. “And by the way,” another told me, after carpet-bombing my notebook with slurs, “he may go down as, if not the greatest, then the most accomplished governor New York has ever had.”
>
> With the press, Cuomo has a reputation for being both exacting and adept. He makes late-night or early-morning calls to reporters—usually off the record, often genial and confiding, sometimes foulmouthed and scathing—which can seem like a gambit to seduce and cow the cadre of regulars assigned to the statehouse beat. He prefers bending an ear to pressing the flesh; the biggest impediment to any designs on the Presidency is the thought of him having to spend weeks in Iowa. Prior to the pandemic briefings, his press conferences were infrequent, his stagecraft tightly controlled. He has a small and loyal team. He is known to have, as one reporter wrote, “an elephant’s long memory for slights.”
> I first approached Cuomo’s office in the spring about spending some time with him. Various members of his staff took up the request and then let it drop. By midsummer, I’d all but given up. Rich Azzopardi, his senior adviser, laughed at my suggestion that I spend a night in the governor’s mansion. In a pandemic? Then, one day in August, my phone rang: Hold for the Governor. He asked to speak off the record, and did so for more than an hour and a half. There was a strange intimacy to the conversation; his timbre was like a pheromone. It didn’t sound as though he were multitasking or pulling faces with his aides. It wasn’t a man just talking to himself, like Nixon at night. He seemed to have all the time in the world. I found myself laughing out loud at some of the Cuomoisms (“We created the we!”), the rhetorical repetitions and Rumsfeldian logic pretzels. I wondered, as I had before, if he was aware of his own peculiarities. For a New Yorker, shtick can be self.
> A few weeks ago, there was another call, this time on background, with quotes to be used only with his later approval. He explained his rationale. “I did four hundred hours of briefings,” he said. “The people can come up with their own opinions of me. They do and they did. They know me better than you know me. And, by the way, they do. They literally do. You bring baggage. They have no baggage. They know me. They know my kids. They know my mother. They know my dog. They came to their own conclusions about me. They don’t need your opinion.”
> The first time I met Cuomo was in 2014, at Billy Joel’s house in Oyster Bay. I was writing about Joel, and he’d invited me to hang around on a morning when he and Cuomo were going out on Joel’s boat for a photo op having to do with cleaning up the bay. The two are good friends. They share an interest in motorcycles and boats, and a pride in being rough-hewn street-smart outsiders vaulted, by talent and luck, into a world of high-class swells. Cuomo presided at Joel’s fourth wedding and is the godfather to his young daughters.
> The two men were alone in the kitchen, not-eating breakfast. Cuomo had on his in-the-field uniform: khakis, white polo shirt with state insignia, tucked in, windbreaker with insignia. They talked about wives and houses. Out on the bay, on the Argos, Joel’s refitted lobster boat, Joel and Cuomo scooped up some plastic for photographers in smaller boats; then they took turns awkwardly scattering panels of oyster seed into the water, to demonstrate support for the oyster-farming operations in the bay and the clean water that they both enable and require.
> Sometime later, I found myself at Joel’s house, on Independence Day. Cuomo was there. Emboldened by a taste of Billy Joel’s gin, I sat down next to the Governor and began to make an argument against an infrastructure project that he’d been promoting, a bridge or a tunnel across Long Island Sound, from Rye to Syosset—a very long and expensive connector between the mainland and the island, to divert traffic from the metropolitan area, that could devastate the region’s shellfishery, which Cuomo and Joel had celebrated a few years earlier. I began to state the case against the project, and Cuomo interrupted and dismissed the premise that there was any oyster fishery worth considering. “They get, what, five oysters a year?” he said. (I’m quoting from memory.) He held forth, in a playfully caustic tone, about NIMBYism, the future of John F. Kennedy Airport as an e-commerce hub, and the virtues of thinking big, in a world of small-minded people, of whom I was presumably one.
> What thrills Cuomo most, to go by his reputation and the evidence, is building things—the kind of big infrastructure projects that might vex more deferential executives. The Second Avenue subway, a new LaGuardia Airport, an expansion of Pennsylvania Station, a replacement for the Tappan Zee Bridge, which he named for his father. Each summoned up a disregard for bureaucratic niceties which some might find refreshing, and a hands-on obsessiveness that is extremely expensive and, for bureaucrats and other hands, crazy-making. As one of those bureaucrats told me, referring to the Cuomo team, “They will slam a bureaucracy for taking too long but then spend an inordinate amount of money to rush it. He is adept at throwing money at a problem. That is a luxury that the bureaucrats don’t have.”
> Still, the travails of the city’s transit system, and of the finances of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, have beset him throughout his tenure. In 2017, soon after celebrating the opening of the Second Avenue subway, a costly project that had been delayed for decades, Cuomo was confronted by the so-called Summer of Hell—an epochal rise in delays, overcrowding, derailments, and signal malfunctions brought on by years of underinvestment and neglect. Unsuccessfully trying to deflect some of the blame and the cost onto Mayor de Blasio, Cuomo, who controls the M.T.A., declared a state of emergency and hired Andy Byford, a respected transit expert who had most recently remade Toronto’s subways, to run the system. Acclaim in the press (including this magazine) for “Train Daddy” reportedly irked the Governor. After two years, Byford quit, complaining that Cuomo had undermined him, hounded his staff, and in general made it impossible for him to do his job.",/r/nyc/comments/j9sl6l/andrew_cuomo_the_king_of_new_york/g8lnt85/

This is not some nefarious plot by Nike, this is political engaged people donating because they care about abortion, or climate change, or whatever they care about as an individual. Everyone who donates when Trump wouldn’t disavow white supremacy or a fly flew on Pence’s head, has to list their employer. And some of the people happened to work at Nike.

Occupy was undermined by two main factors. One, it didn't have an evocative rallying image. Here you have graphic video of a police officer intentionally killing an unresisting arrestee.

Two, and perhaps most critically, Occupy didn't have a clear goal. It wasn't directed at any particular corporation. It wasn't clear what particular legislation the protesters wanted to see from the government (and which government, federal or state or city?). Many of the protesters didn't even agree with each other on what needed to be done. Yes, they all agreed our existing system needed ""reform,"" but what reform specifically? Some of the Occupy protesters wanted the end of capitalism. Many took aim at the link between our economic system and institutionalized racism. Others prioritized an expansion of the safety net. Still others focused mainly on the need for new environmental regulations to fight climate change.

We patronize them for their incompleteness, for their tragic fate for having taken form so far below ourselves.  And therein do we err.  For the animal shall not be measured by man.  In a world older and more complete than ours, they move finished and complete, gifted with the extension of the senses we have lost or never attained, living by voices we shall never hear.

If NYC is really trying to be a leader in the shift towards lower emissions to prevent climate change (as the Mayor and others purport it to be), it really ought to reflect that in how it allocates the budget.

Demand for subway and other transit could easily be eased by providing safer options for walking and micromobility. Building up the infrastructure for non-car and non-transit use would go a long way in the city.

I'm totally optimistic that we can get through the capitalist crisis together. Yes, capitalism has generated grinding poverty for the majority of human beings on earth, it has dispossessed backwoods farmers of their land in Mexico and Nigeria and India and forced them to work in factories, and worst of all, it has rewarded behavior which has caused climate change and actually threatens our capacity to feed the world. Acknowledging the systemic nature of these crises is not pessimism, it is simply acknowledging reality. 

But, despite the grim state of things, I think as the crisis worsens, we'll see a resurgence in anticapitalist politics, union membership, and perhaps get closer to a General Strike which reminds those who lord over us with their exotic cars and mansions and stock options while we freeze and starve - that without the working class, their money and wealth means nothing. Already lots of young people are refusing to work - and we're building off-grid cabins and gardens and letting our student loans go into default. We aren't spending money, and we're sending a message that people ain't feeling this bullshit anymore. This will bloom into full-scale resistance, and we'll be able to establish worker control of our workplaces, build worker co-ops and community subsistence programs and so on. 

I don't mean any disrespect to your struggle, but remember that not everyone can walk door to door. Some of my friends have been caught up in slum-level poverty for so long, they don't know how to talk to people outside their bubble. Big black dudes with felonies and face tattoos can't go door to door most places. Immigrants without papers who stay for their families can't do that. There are only so many ways the bootstraps thing works - but socialism is for *everyone*. We don't need to hold one another in contempt in a nation where we'd all be millionaires if the wealth were evenly distributed, and most productive tasks could be automated and the total working hours of the entire nation could be slashed radically. I'm optimistic that we'll get there, despite disinformation, propaganda, and a compromised political system - and despite the constant efforts of the elite to keep the working class down and divided.",/r/nyc/comments/9wufk9/bezos_helipad/e9oevcd/

Right except when it comes to actually creating the law. Do you think Pelosi is more likely to endorse and fight for the Green New Deal or approve the Trump admin's climate policies? I'll give you a hint, we already have the answer dozens of times over.

> Democrats advance healthcare in a way that's more fair for everyone

Not only is it a total fucking sham to pretend that Obamacare did this, the DNC literally spent this whole cycle uniting and closing ranks to absolutely oppose universal healthcare. lmao they didn't even lie about it, they're more concerned with assuring the insurance industries that they're chill than they are with pretending to be on your side for votes. They would literally rather lose and get the Republican policies -- which work just fine for them and their backers -- than lose the support of the insurance industry, which affects their personal bottom lines.

> Democrats can put together a comprehensive and legible foreign policy, Republcans enable Trump who tweets threats of military violence to other countries before telling the Pentagon anything.

The most hardcore Trump supporter would throw in the towel  if Trump had told them lies and miss informed them  as many times as the democrats and mainstream media has lied to you and misinformed you fools,. From the fake news story that Michael Brown had his hands up and was shot in the back, to the Russian collusion hoax and everything in between, your politicians and media have blown smoke up your asses for decades and you fools stand there waiting for more .

If Trump had done what the Obamas done, telling all you gullible idiots that the oceans would rise 4 feet in 5 years due to man made climate change, then ran out and bought a 15 million dollar ultra extravagant oceanfront mansion  , I would never believe him again, , but oh no not you fools,  they preach to you about income inequality from their penthouse apartments and private jets,  and you stand there and cheer, 

I do, I truly do feel sorry for people that small minded and gullible. .

Tomorrow I want you to count how many abandoned factories there are within a 20 mile radius of where you live, then go to walmart and see how many american made items you can find, then try to find an american made cell phone , then go to google maps street view in Tokyo, and see how many american cars you can find,  THEN ask yourself why your porty would claim our trade deals are fine and Trump is bad for wanting to fix them.

It's not strictly that, but ""rich vs poor"" has a very significant place in the debate about preservationism

At least in the US, basically the entirety of law around ""preservation"" focuses on property, and the people who own property anywhere, but especially NYC, are rich. And in particular, the people who can afford to hire property lawyers to navigate the confused legal situation around preservation are rich. And the people who own property and who tend to be very into preservation also tend to be rich, white homeowners

However, it's an interesting ""rich vs poor"" issue because there are people in both socioeconomic camps arguing each side. On the ""anti-preservation"" side, you get both developers and working people arguing against them. For developers, it's opposition to what they see as burdensome regulation preventing them from building what they want. For people who think that the best way to solve an acute housing shortage and high rents is to...build more housing, historical preservation is a posterchild for NIMBYism that prevents the desperately needed housing from being built

On the other side of the coin, both rich and poor preservationists have basically the same argument - it preserves ""neighborhood character"". For the rich its also about housing values, but because people who own property are much more likely to attend public meetings, lobby their representatives, etc, they have a disproportionate voice. But some pro-preservationists who aren't rich point to the potential for preservation to fight gentrification by preserving existing communities, and preventing the poor from being priced out (though there's also an anti-preservation argument that says that historical preservation basically is a catalyst for gentrification by making it easier for developers to buy up homes and ""restore"" them, making them more attractive to rich white people). There's also a climate change argument - restoring a building emits far less carbon than demolishing it and building something new in its space. All that steel and concrete cost carbon to mine, refine, manufacture, transport, and construct after all

Both these arguments have their strengths

It's a difficult issue in general because - what is ""preservationism"" preserving, actually? In major public spaces and architectural marvels like Penn Station or Grand Central, it's obvious and pretty un-debatable. It's preserving both the building itself, and the enormous public space that it functions as. The shops might change, but there were people taking the train buying breakfast in Grand Central every morning no matter the era. Preserving the building also preserves the space itself?

But what about ""preserving"" some old tenement building on the Lower East Side? Preservation in the US works mostly related to the *property* and *building* itself. A building that once housed first generation Jewish refugees in filthy, overcrowded conditions now houses ""yuppies"" who work in finance. Even if the physical building of the old tenement, its facade, etc is preserved - does that have value if nothing of the *people who actually lived in that building* remains?",/r/nyc/comments/gr8epc/if_pennsylvania_station_still_existed/fry38w0/

Yes, plastic in the ocean is a big problem. I totally agree. 

Yes, there are a handful of studies that show a decrease in plastic litter in specific parts of the ocean over a period when plastic bags were banned in nearby areas. That might be a positive sign. 

On the flipside, the things that tend to replace plastic bags (paper bags and cotton bags) have environmental impacts of their own that are not trivial. 

As environmental policy, plastic bag bans are also very high on the scale of inconvenience vs environmental benefit, and generate political friction of their own when it comes to addressing national and international environmental issues like energy policy, agricultural policy, and climate change.

The last two paragraphs of [this Wired article you posted](https://www.wired.com/2016/06/banning-plastic-bags-great-world-right-not-fast/) are particularly instructive:

>The larger takeaway is that no bag is free of environmental impact, whether that’s contributing to climate change, ocean pollution, water scarcity, or pesticide use. The instinct to favor reusable bags springs from an understandable urge to reduce our chronic overconsumption, but the bags we use are not the big problem.
